*   **Inventory Mismanagement:** Fluctuations between excess inventory and stockouts caused by poor forecast accuracy.
*   **Revenue Leakage:** Inability to track negative effective margins and operational expenses at a granular level.

**The Goal:** To engineer a centralized, automated, and interactive BI tool that provides actionable insights for **Profitability Analysis**, **Marketing ROI**, and **Supply Chain Efficiency**.
